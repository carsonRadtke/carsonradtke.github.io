## Hello!

My name is Carson, I am currently working on Microsoft's MSVC C++ Code Analysis product. 
We ship a number of C++ static analysis checks that ship inside of Visual Studio. I
currently live in Colorado and enjoy camping, fishing, and hiking. This site is a
collection of posts written by me on topics that I find interesting. Opinions expressed
in these posts are solely my own and do not express the views nor opinions of my
employer.
